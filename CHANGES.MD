# Changes & Timeline

## lol.txt contains some of my working with ASTs & though mostly mental scribbles

## First commit 8th may

## 11th of May: basic interpreter was working, with AST hashing


## 12th of May: Realized that my strategy for evaluating ASTs was absolutely braindead and only worked for addition & multiplication & Exponents, failed miserably for alternatives

## 14th of May: Worked on register renaming (partial support) & Cleaning up for Google Code Format, finished mostly, did not touch after this

## 31st of May: Contacted Mr. Hauswirth asking for the exception (Maybe too late), should've actually contacted way earlier

## 3rd of June: cleaning things up for project, need to add Maven for code style check, didn't manage to get all the checkstyle stuff done, did manage to get it google-java-format ready though.
